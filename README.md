# Excel-Coffee-Shop-Project
### OBJECTIVE-
This project analyzes sales data for a fictional coffee shop chain to uncover trends in revenue over time, product performance, and store location insights.
The goal was to create a clear, professional dashboard that could help stakeholders quickly understand which areas of business drive the most sales.
The entire dashboard was built using the free version of Excel.

- "Time Brackets" (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- Corrected formatting on columns

- Sales by product category
- Sales by transaction time

### INSIGHTS
*SALES BY PRODUCT CATEGORY*
~ Coffee and Tea are the top revenue-generating categories.
~ Bakery and Drinking Chocolate follow as moderate contributors.
~ Packaged Chocolate, Flavours, and Loose Tea generated minimal sales.
(The shop's main profits come from beverages, particularly coffee-based products)

*SALES TREND OVER TIME*
~June brought the highest revenue overall, showing a steady increase in sales throughout the first half of the year. This upward trend suggests strong customer growth and effective sales strategies over time.

*SALES BY TRANSACTION TIME*
~ The morning period has the highest sales volume, aligning with typical coffee shop patterns (morning coffee rush).
~ Afternoon and Evening sales are noticeably lower.
 - Suggestion: introduce afternoon specials or evening promotions to attract more customers later in the day.
   
*TOTAL SALES BY STORE LOCATION*
~ Hell's Kitchen leads in total sales, followed by Astoria and Lower Manhattan
 - Suggestion: explore factors such as foot traffic, local events, or demographics to improve sales in lower-performing stores.

[The data highlights strong morning demand and dominance of beverage sales, especially coffee.
Sales have been increasing steadily, with June marking the highest performance overall.
However, there is room for growth in evening sales and lower-performing store locations.]
